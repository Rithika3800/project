        Madison has been with us throughout our househunting journey. As newcomers to Canada,<br>
         we were not aware of how the market was fairing. Since our first meeting, Madison has <br>
         guided us through the basic principles and gave us the relevant information about how<br>
          to find a house, within our budget and preferred area. She is resourceful, always available<br>
           and listened constantly to our needs.Thank you Madison for helping us find our home which met<br>
         our criteria and for being with us from the beginning to the end of this journey!</p>

            Smooth transaction – sold within 5 days of listing and bought within 2 weeks of selling.<br>
            Madison walked us through the entire process from start to finish. She was knowledgeable of the area,<br> 
             understood what we wanted, and gave us real insight into the market, trends, challenges, and advised us<br>.
             Her recommendations were on point and gave us confidence when listing our Home for sale. We appreciate and<br>
              value her services and recommend her to anyone who is considering selling their home- even if it's just a conversation <br>
              – you will not be disappointed.</p>

            You have done it again !!!!. Thank you Anuja for your tireless effort in selling our home.<br>
             Even in a crazy market time like this, you still managed to sell our home.<br>
              I know there were many frustrating moments and questionable situations, yet once<br>
               again you prevailed and sold our house. Thank you for being there for us and with us <br>
               through this journey. We really appreciate all your help and hard work. Wishing you <br>
               many more success in all your endeavors.</p>
